Concept: First-person present positive (self/as a proxy)
Note: As a proxy refers to speaking about someone/something in a simple present context - Eg: It rains a lot in Ziro = Jiro ho ano mwdo hu[du]. It is never used in the present continuous context.
Examples:
  - apatani/hari: Qo api√± dw[du] = I am having food
  - galo/darka: Qo ahin do[du] = I am having food
